# Strategic Recommendation: Pricing for SaaS Productivity Tool

## 1. Model Comparison

### Freemium
*   **Pros**:
    *   Low barrier to entry; rapid user acquisition (viral growth).
    *   Builds a large asset of users for future monetization.
*   **Cons**:
    *   High support/infrastructure costs for free users.
    *   Difficult to convert free users if the free tier is "too good".

### Tiered Subscription (Free Trial)
*   **Pros**:
    *   Immediate revenue validation.
    *   Attracts higher-intent buyers.
    *   Clearer value perception (premium product).
*   **Cons**:
    *   Higher Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) initially.
    *   Slower top-of-funnel growth.

## 2. Recommendation
**Hybrid Freemium (Feature-Gated)**
For a productivity tool, user habit formation is key. I recommend a generous **Free Tier** for individual use to drive adoption, with a **Pro Tier** gated by collaboration features (e.g., shared workspaces, unlimited history) and advanced integrations.
*   *Why?* Productivity tools rely on network effects. You want individuals to love it and then "infect" their teams, forcing an upgrade to the Team/Enterprise plans.

## 3. Key Considerations
*   **Conversion Rate**: Target a 2-5% free-to-paid conversion rate.
*   **Churn**: Watch specifically for "activation churn" (users who sign up but never perform a key action).
*   **CAC Payback**: Ensure paid users cover acquisition costs within <12 months.
