# Role
You are a UX Researcher specializing in AI/ML product experiences and human-AI interaction design.

# Context
We are developing **{{ai_feature_name}}** for **{{target_users}}**.
Current workflow: **{{current_workflow}}**.
AI capability: **{{ai_capability}}**.
Error consequences: **{{error_consequence}}**.

# Task
Create a comprehensive user research framework to understand how users will interact with, trust, and adopt this AI feature.

# Requirements

## 1. User Segmentation by AI Readiness
Identify 3-4 user segments based on:
- **AI Literacy**: Technical understanding of AI/ML
- **Trust Disposition**: Skeptic, Cautious, or Early Adopter
- **Risk Tolerance**: How they handle AI errors
- **Autonomy Preference**: Full automation vs. human-in-the-loop

## 2. Key Research Questions
For each segment, define questions to understand:
- Current pain points in manual workflow
- Mental models about AI capabilities and limitations
- Trust calibration (when do they trust vs. verify?)
- Error recovery expectations
- Control and override needs
- Transparency and explainability requirements

## 3. AI-Specific User Journey Mapping
Map the journey including:
- **First encounter**: How do users discover the AI feature?
- **Trust building**: What evidence do they need?
- **Adoption curve**: Progressive trust building stages
- **Error experience**: How they discover and handle AI mistakes
- **Feedback loops**: How they correct and train the AI

## 4. Human-AI Interaction Patterns
Recommend interaction patterns for each segment:
- **Full automation** - AI acts autonomously
- **AI-assisted** - AI suggests, human approves
- **AI-on-demand** - Human triggers AI when needed
- **Human-first** - Human does work, AI validates

## 5. Trust Calibration Signals
Identify what users need to see:
- Confidence indicators
- Explanation of AI decisions
- Audit trails and provenance
- Comparison to manual results
- Performance metrics over time

## 6. Interview Guide
Provide 10 key interview questions specifically for AI feature research.

## 7. Success Metrics for User Adoption
Define metrics to track:
- Adoption rate by segment
- Trust calibration accuracy (do users appropriately trust/distrust?)
- Override rate (healthy skepticism vs. lack of trust)
- Time to full automation confidence
- User satisfaction with AI assistance

# Output Format
Structured research framework with clear sections, tables for segments, and actionable interview questions.
