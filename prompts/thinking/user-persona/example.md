# User Persona: "Freelance Fiona"

## Profile
*   **Name**: Fiona Design
*   **Age**: 28
*   **Role**: Freelance Graphic Designer
*   **Location**: Portland, OR (Works from shared co-working spaces)
*   **Income**: $65k - $80k (fluctuating)

## Goals
*   **Streamline Admin**: Wants to spend less time on invoices/emails and more time designing.
*   **Scale Revenue**: Wants to take on more clients without burning out.
*   **Professionalism**: Wants to look like a "big agency" to her clients.

## Pain Points
*   **Context Switching**: Hates jumping between Slack, Trello, and Gmail to find client feedback.
*   **Chasing Payments**: Awkward conversations asking clients to pay late invoices.
*   **Scope Creep**: Difficulty tracking hours against fixed-price projects.

## Product Fit (TaskMaster)
*   **Unified Dashboard**: TaskMaster's "Client Portal" feature solves context switching by keeping all assets and chats in one place.
*   **Automated Invoicing**: Solves the "Chasing Payments" pain point by sending polite auto-reminders.
*   **Time Tracking**: Built-in timer helps her see exactly when a project is becoming unprofitable due to scope creep.
