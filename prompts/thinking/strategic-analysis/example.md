## 4. Strategic Recommendations
1.  **Niche Down**: Do not complete head-on with Lexis/Westlaw on general research. Focus on a specific vertical (e.g., Intellectual Property or Immigration).
2.  **Trust & Safety First**: Differentiate by offering indemnification against "hallucinations" – a major fear for lawyers.
3.  **Integration Play**: Build plugins for Microsoft Word/Outlook where lawyers spend 90% of their time, rather than a standalone platform.
