# Competitor Comparison: Slack vs. Teams (for RocketChat Strategy)

| Feature | Slack | Microsoft Teams |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Chat** | Best-in-class UX, huddles, intuitive threading. | Functional, but often feels heavy/slow. Strong threading. |
| **Pricing** | Freemium, expensive Pro tiers ($8/user/mo). | Included in M365 bundle (effectively "free" for many orgs). |
| **Integrations** | Massive ecosystem (2,000+ apps), dev-friendly APIs. | Deep integration with Office (Word, Excel, SharePoint). |
| **UX/UI** | Playful, polished, "human" feel. | Corporate, dense, utilitarian. |

## Opportunity Analysis for RocketChat

**The Gap**:
*   **Slack** is great but getting expensive and lacks data sovereignty (SaaS only).
*   **Teams** is "free" but hated by developers for its UX and locked ecosystem.

**RocketChat's Blue Ocean**:
1.  **Data Sovereignty/On-Premise**: Target highly regulated industries (Gov, Healthcare, Finance) that *cannot* use Slack/Teams cloud. neither competitor offers a robust self-hosted option anymore.
2.  **Open Source Customizability**: Appeal to technical teams who want to "hack" their chat interface or build deep custom integrations that Slack's API limits.
3.  **White Labeling**: Offer RocketChat as an embedded chat engine for *other* SaaS products, a market Slack/Teams completely ignore.
