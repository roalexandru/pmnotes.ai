# PRD Outline: Mobile Fitness App

## 1. Problem Statement
Many busy professionals want to stay fit but lack the time for long gym sessions or the knowledge to construct effective home workouts. Existing apps are either too complex (hardcore bodybuilding) or too generic (running apps).

## 2. Target Audience
**"Work-from-Home Warrior"**: A busy professional (30-45 years old) working remotely. They have 20-30 minutes gaps between meetings and want high-intensity, efficient workouts requiring no equipment.

## 3. Key Features (MVP)
*   **Smart Time-Boxing**: Generate a workout based on exact available time (e.g., "I have 15 minutes").
*   **Video Guidance**: High-quality, loopable GIFs/Videos for each exercise.
*   **Progress Tracking**: Simple log of workouts completed and streak counter.
*   **Calendar Sync**: Suggested workout times based on calendar gaps.

## 4. User Stories
*   As a user, I want to input my available time (e.g., 20 mins) so that I get a perfectly tailored workout.
*   As a user, I want to see a video demonstration of "Burpees" so I perform them safely.
*   As a user, I want to view my weekly streak so I feel motivated to not break the chain.

## 5. Success Metrics
*   **Primary Metric**: % of users who complete at least 3 workouts in their first week (Activation).
*   **Secondary Metrics**:
    *   Average workout duration.
