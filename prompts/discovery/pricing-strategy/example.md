# Pricing Strategy: B2B SaaS Productivity Tool

## Summary Recommendation
Adopt a **tiered subscription** with a limited freemium entry point to drive adoption, then convert teams to paid tiers based on collaboration limits and advanced admin controls.

## Model Comparison

| Model | Pros | Cons | Fit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Freemium | Fast top-of-funnel growth | Low conversion if free tier too generous | Good for PLG adoption | 
| Tiered Subscription | Clear value ladder | Needs strong packaging discipline | Strong for mid-market | 
| Usage-based | Aligns price to value | Harder to predict spend | Best for variable usage | 

## Packaging Proposal

| Tier | Target Customer | Value Metric | Indicative Price | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Starter | Small teams | Per active seat | $10–12/user/mo | Core tasks, basic collaboration |
| Team | Growing teams | Per active seat | $18–22/user/mo | SSO, advanced permissions, integrations |
| Enterprise | 500+ seats | Per active seat + volume discount | $24–30/user/mo | Compliance, audit logs, dedicated support |

## Metrics to Monitor
* Free-to-paid conversion rate and activation-to-paid time.
* Net revenue retention (expansion vs. contraction).
* CAC payback period and gross margin.

## Risks & Experiments
* **Risk**: Free tier cannibalizes paid conversions.
* **Experiment**: A/B test collaboration limits in free tier over 60 days.
* **Risk**: Enterprise buyers require procurement-friendly packaging.
* **Experiment**: Pilot annual contracts with 2–3 design partners.
