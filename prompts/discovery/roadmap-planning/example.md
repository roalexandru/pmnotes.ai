# Product Roadmap: DevOps Dashboard (4 Quarters)

## Roadmap Table

| Quarter | Theme                 | Initiatives                                                        | Metric Impact                       |
| :------ | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Q1      | Activation Foundation | Guided onboarding, alert webhook integrations, improved dashboards | +5% activation, +10% WAU            |
| Q2      | Adoption Expansion    | SSO, public status pages, team sharing                             | +15% trial-to-paid conversion       |
| Q3      | Mobile Launch         | iOS/Android app (read-only), push notifications                    | +8% WAU, +5% retention              |
| Q4      | Enterprise Readiness  | Audit logs, SOC2 readiness, anomaly detection beta                 | -3% churn, +20% enterprise pipeline |

## Sequencing Rationale

We start with activation and onboarding to improve funnel efficiency, then expand adoption via collaboration features. Mobile drives retention, and Q4 focuses on enterprise readiness aligned with SOC2 requirements.

## Dependencies & Risks

- SOC2 audit timeline may shift Q4 delivery.
- Mobile app depends on design system updates from the platform team.
